# pwshbot
This is a twitch chat bot written in my favorite programming language, PowerShell!
Please be cautious as this invokes actual powershell code as commands!

## How to use
- (If you are NOT on windows) Install powershell https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell?view=powershell-6
- Copy `config-example.ps1` to `config.ps1` and fill in the values.
- Copy your bots oauth token into a file called `token.txt`.
- Run main.ps1 in `powershell`/`pwsh`.
- Drag this folder into the Recycle Bin.
